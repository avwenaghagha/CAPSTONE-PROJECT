# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
## END TO END ENGINEERING SOLUTION
### Introduction
 The project involves an end-to-end data engineering solution utilizing Azure Data Factory for data ingestion from an on-premises SQL Server, followed by data storage in Azure Blob Storage. Data processing is performed using Azure Databricks with PySpark and Spark SQL, culminating in data analysis and visualization through Power BI, which integrates with Azure Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards.

### TECHNOLOGY USED
## The technologies used in your data engineering project include:
- Azure Data Factory for data ingestion
- SQL Server (on-premises) as the data source
- Azure Blob Storage for data storage
- Azure Databricks for data processing
- PySpark and Spark SQL for data transformation
- Power BI for data analysis and dashboarding
- Programming language ,phyton and SQL.
  # Using Azure Data Factory (ADF) for ETL processes offers several advantages over Databricks:
- User-Friendly Interface: ADF provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface that simplifies the creation of ETL pipelines, making it accessible for users with less technical expertise. This contrasts with Databricks, which generally requires more coding and technical skills to set up and manage workflows.
- Built-in Connectors and Integration: ADF includes over 90 built-in connectors to various data sources, both cloud-based and on-premises, facilitating easier data ingestion and integration. This extensive connectivity simplifies the process of orchestrating data movement from multiple sources compared to Databricks, which may require additional configuration for certain data sources.
- Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability: ADF operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which can be more cost-effective for organizations that need to scale their data integration processes without incurring high upfront costs. It is designed to handle large-scale data integration tasks efficiently, allowing businesses to manage their data workflows flexibly and economically.
- Orchestration and Monitoring: ADF excels in orchestrating complex workflows and provides robust monitoring capabilities to track the performance and execution of data pipelines. This feature allows users to set up alerts and manage pipeline activities effectively, ensuring operational efficiency and minimizing downtime.
- These advantages make Azure Data Factory particularly well-suited for organizations looking for a comprehensive, user-friendly ETL solution that integrates seamlessly with other Azure services.
  ## In conclusion, this data engineering project demonstrates a well-designed and efficient data pipeline that leverages the strengths of various Azure services and technologies. By integrating Azure Data Factory for data ingestion, Azure Blob Storage for data storage, Azure Databricks for data processing using PySpark and Spark SQL, and Power BI for data analysis and dashboarding,creating a robust and scalable solution that can effectively handle large-scale data processing and visualization requirements.
